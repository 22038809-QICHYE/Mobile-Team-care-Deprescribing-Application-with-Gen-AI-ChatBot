Aspirin,"Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, non-COX-2-selective, Antiplatelets","1. 
Risk of major bleeding from aspirin increases markedly in older age. Studies suggest a lack of net benefit and potential for net harm when initiated for primary prevention in older adults. There is less evidence about stopping aspirin among long-term users, although similar principles for initiation may apply. 
Note: Aspirin is generally indicated for secondary prevention in older adults with established cardiovascular disease.

2. 
Increased risk of GI bleeding or peptic ulcer disease in high-risk groups, including those >75 years old or taking oral or parenteral corticosteroids, anticoagulants, or antiplatelet agents; use of proton-pump inhibitor or misoprostol reduces but does not eliminate risk. 
Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occur in ~1% of patients treated for 3–6 months and in ~2%–4% of patients treated for 1 year; these trends continue with longer duration of use.  Also can increase blood pressure and induce kidney injury. Risks are dose-related.","1.
Avoid initiating aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Consider deprescribing aspirin in older adults already taking it for primary prevention.

2.
Applicable for aspirin >325 mg/day:
Avoid chronic use unless other alternatives are not effective and the patient can take a gastroprotective agent (proton-pump inhibitor or misoprostol).

Use in heart failure: evidence for benefits and harms of digoxin is conflicting and of lower quality; most (but not all) evidence concerns use in HFrEF. There is strong evidence for other agents as first-line therapy to reduce hospitalizations and mortality in adults with HFrEF. In heart failure, higher dosages are not associated with additional benefits and may increase the risk of toxicity. Use caution in discontinuing digoxin among current users with HFrEF, given limited evidence suggesting worse clinical outcomes after discontinuation. 

Decreased renal clearance of digoxin may lead to an increased risk of toxic effects; further dose reduction may be necessary for those with Stage 4 or 5 chronic kidney disease.","Avoid this rate control agent as first-line therapy for atrial fibrillation.
